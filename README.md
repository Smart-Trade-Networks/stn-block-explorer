## Installation (Tom's Process)

```
git clone https://github.com/sthnaqvi/explorer
nvm use v8.9.0
npm install
npm start
```


## Tom's steps for running on the server

ensure package.json file under start the ip address is changed to the ip address of the server 
e.g. "start": "http-webnode ./app -a 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 -c-1"
should be changed to: "http-webnode ./app -a 65.21.7.175 -p 8000 -c-1"

you can use pm2 but I'm using screen
So once on the server use

1. Opne a new screen session as in here: https://youtu.be/3S3I9lT6eKE?t=171

```
screen
npm run start

If I want to close the process I can:
1. Kill the process or
2. restart the computer from the hosting portal, just to give the computer a refresh.
